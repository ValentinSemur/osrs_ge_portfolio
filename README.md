# osrs_ge_portfolio

# Summary
My goal is to create an R program that uses the API of the OSRS GE
to get historical data on prices, and creates a portfolio of items
to invest in to make in-game money purely through financial analysis
and with little game knowledge.

# Better description
This program is intended to scrape the prices of the Great Exchange
in Old School Runescape through its public API in order to build a 
dataset of historic prices.

The following goal is to construct portfolios of items to buy in order
to make money in the game purely through financial analysis and almost
no game knowledge.
